# Name

site-install -- install the w3 application

# Synopsis

    site-install

# Description

After `site-init` you might invoke this script to install the w3.uib.no
application from scratch.  This will install the application with all the
required modules, but without any content (areas or articles).

Alternatively, invoke `site-prod-reset` to just install a copy of the
production site, with all the current content ready for playing around with.
