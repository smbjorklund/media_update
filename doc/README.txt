This is the developer documentation for the eksternweb application.  If you
prefer to read this stuff in a browser then try to run 'make' to generate the
HTML files and then visit 'index.html'.  You might also browse the HTML at:

   http://phpdoc.devapp.uib.no/w3/

which should be automatically updated by jenkins.uib.no (job "doc-w3").

The .md files in this directory are written using the [markdown][] markup
language.

When you introduce a new .md-file you want to register the corresponding
HTML file at the top of `Makefile` and provide a link to it from `index.md`.
